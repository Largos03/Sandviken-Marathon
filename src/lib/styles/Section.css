/* ========== SECTION STYLING ========== */
/* This file contains styles for page sections used throughout the Sandviken Marathon website */

/* 
 * Fade-in animation class for sections
 * This is applied to sections to create a fade-in and slide-up effect as they enter the viewport
 * The animation is triggered by JavaScript that adds the "visible" class when the section is scrolled into view
 */

  opacity: 0;                    /* Starts completely invisible */
  transform: translateY(20px);   /* Starts 20px below its final position */
  transition: opacity 0.8s ease, transform 0.8s ease; /* Smooth animation for both opacity and position */
}

/* 
 * When this class is added (by JavaScript), the section becomes visible
 * This creates the animation effect as users scroll down the page
 */

/* 
 * Small decorative divider line used below section titles
 * Creates a small horizontal line that helps separate the title from content
 */

 * Container for section titles and introductory text
 * Used at the top of each major section of the website
